 Data Pagination and Filtering project

In this project I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

I started with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. Then I used JavaScript to display the first nine students on the page. I created pagination buttons that the user can click to display different pages of students.

This application is flexible enough to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students.
